## (ii) Stack Operations using Class

- **File:** `stack.py`  
- **Concepts Covered:**  
  - Stack data structure (LIFO principle)  
  - Class and object usage in Python  
  - Stack operations: `push()`, `pop()`, `peek()`, `size()`  
  - Use of lists to implement stack behavior  

### Description:
The program defines a class `stack` that represents a **stack data structure**.  
It allows performing common stack operations such as adding, removing, and viewing elements.  
The test section demonstrates how items are pushed onto the stack, popped from it, and how the current top element and size can be checked.

### Example Output:
50
40
4
