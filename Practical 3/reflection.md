## Reflection — Stack Operations

### Discuss What I Learned:
- Learned how a **stack works** using the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** concept.  
- Understood how to **implement stack operations** using Python’s list methods.  
- Practiced using **classes and objects** to organize code in a structured way.  
- Gained better understanding of **method definitions** and object interaction.  

### Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them:
- **Challenge:** Initially faced confusion between `pop()` and `peek()` operations.  
  **Solution:** Tested both methods separately and printed intermediate results to understand the difference.  
- **Challenge:** Encountered `IndexError` when popping from an empty stack.  
  **Solution:** Added a condition to check `is_empty()` before performing `pop()`.
