# Practical No. 1 â€“ Python Basics

This practical contains basic Python operation exercises to understand fundamental programming concepts such as:

- *Booleans*
- *Type Conversion*
- *Strings*
- *Numbers*
- *Operators*

Each file demonstrates a specific concept with examples.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Description

- *a) Boolean.py*  
  Demonstrates Boolean values (True, False) and logical operators (and, or, not).  
  ![Boolean Example](../Images/boolen.png)

- *b) Numbers.py*  
  Example of True/False values, comparisons, and arithmetic operations.  
  ![Numbers Output](../Images/image-1.png)

- *c) String.py*  
  Shows string creation, concatenation, slicing, and basic methods.  
  ![String Example](../Images/image-2.png)

- *d) Type_conversion.py*  
  Demonstrates conversion between data types (e.g., int â†’ str, str â†’ float).  
  ![Type Conversion](../Images/image-3.png)

- *e) Operators.py*  
  Examples of arithmetic, relational, and logical operators.
