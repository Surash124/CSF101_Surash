# Reflection

## Discuss What I Learned
- Learned how to define and call functions in Python.  
- Understood the concept of recursion and how a function can call itself.  
- Learned the difference between **iterative** and **recursive** approaches.  
- Gained a better understanding of **loops**, **variables**, and **updating values**.  
- Improved debugging and commenting practices while coding.

## Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them

### Challenge 1: Recursive Function Confusion
- **Issue:** I initially got confused about how recursive calls return values and when the function stops.  
- **Solution:** I used print statements and base conditions to visualize the call flow, which helped me understand the recursion process better.

### Challenge 2: Logical Error in Iterative Loop
- **Issue:** At first, my loop printed wrong numbers due to incorrect updating of `a` and `b`.  
- **Solution:** Debugged step-by-step and used a temporary variable `c` to fix the logic.
