# Reflection

## Discuss What You Learned

- Understood Python basics — data types, variables, and operators.  
- Learned to use **control structures** like if-else, loops, break, and continue.  
- Practice **data structures** — lists, dictionaries, and stacks.  
- Learned to define and call **functions**, use parameters, recursion, and scopes.  
- Gained skills in **file handling** — reading, writing, and managing text/binary files.  
- Applied **logical and comparison operators** for decision-making.  
- Improved overall **problem-solving and debugging** abilities.

## Challenges I Faced and How I Overcame Them

- **Dictionary KeyError:** Occurred when accessing missing keys.  
   Fixed using `.get()` method or checking key existence.  

- **Loop Errors:** Some loops ran infinitely.  
   Corrected with proper conditions and `break`/`continue`.
   also not to add numbers and any symbols first while naming them  

- **File Handling Issues:** Wrong paths caused read/write errors.  
   Solved by verifying file paths and using `with open()` safely.  

These challenges improved my understanding of debugging and logical thinking in programming.
