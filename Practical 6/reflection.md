## Reflection — Searching Algorithms (Linear and Binary Search)

### Discuss What I Learned:
- Learned the **difference between Linear and Binary Search**.  
- Understood that **Binary Search requires a sorted list**, while Linear Search does not.  
- Practiced **loop-based searching** and using **conditions to compare elements**.  
- Learned that **Linear Search checks each element one by one**, making it simple and useful for small or unsorted datasets.  
- Realized how search algorithms are applied in real-world examples like  
  ranking students or checking class attendance.  
- Improved understanding of **indexing and iteration** in lists.  


### Challenges Faced and How I Overcame Them:
- **Challenge:** Binary Search gave wrong results when the list wasn’t sorted.  
  **Solution:** Ensured data was sorted before performing binary search.  
- **Challenge:** Off-by-one errors while finding ranks in descending order.  
  **Solution:** Adjusted index calculations and verified through test cases.  
- **Challenge:** Misplaced return statement in Linear Search loop.  
  **Solution:** Debugged step-by-step and moved return statement after the loop.
